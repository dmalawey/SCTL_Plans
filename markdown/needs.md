The following links offer guidance on coding and development of documentation.  Originating from the software world, the term "documentation" in the open source context has its own story, best practices, and living community behind several projects that are helping engineers document their work for open collaboration.

* [Docsify this](https://docsify-this.net/#/) - a toolkit made by educator Paul Hibbits to generate docs.
* [Readthedocs.io](https://readthedocs.org/) - a system that integrates into git repository for documenting software automatically.  May not be the great for documenting non-software projects.
