### CAD support in Fusion360

Let's make our native CAD models more accessible.  Fusion360 is the most desirable next CAD software to support, due to a large population of users.  We don't want to drop Solidworks, because we've invested a good amount of engineering in advanced Solidworks features for assembly configuration, BOM generator, and rendering.  However, there's nothing special about the parts geometries that cannot be reproduced in F360.

> * Reproduce key models in Fusion360
> * Establish parametric models for pulleys and flat brackets to easily pivot for new variations.
> * Generate youtube videos to introduce non-experts in modifying our parts by simple parameters.

## Documentation Projects <a name="docProjects"></a>

Unlike other open source designs, SCUTTLE is uniquely multidisciplinary (really... we studied this for a long time).  Open projects' success really boils down to good documentation.  For software, circuit designs, and each discipline there are already best practices and at least one design that stands out as the leader.  That means SCUTTLE won't be the best at anything if we try to take leadership.  Instead, we will aim to make our documentation more of a curation of the best in each field.  We can honor the works of expert authors by pulling them into the place in the SCUTTLE projects where our users need such resource.  We avoid reinventing the wheel and we only invent a wheel when the existing wheel isn't digestible by our audience.  In 2018, we made a large number of videos for Beagleboard that were already covered in beginners linux courses.  But, these videos became a shortcut towards outcomes when the learners are burdened with too many disciplines at once.


### Converge Diagrams resources

We no longer need to sketch electronics in MS paint.  Many distributors now offer clean images of popular boards, such as [schemeit](https://digikey.com/schemeit) and we just need to show the community where the best options are.  That in turn yields better projects documentation and more repeatable project contributions.

> * compile a cheat sheet for how to tinker with them quickly, or pass files from one to another.

### Diagrams Library

Most SCUTTLE projects start and end with a diagram.  Functional block diagrams and components diagrams work best with a visual aid.  We want to produce a library of key components

> * produce PNG files for mechanical hardware icons
> * produce PNG files for electronics hardware icons
> * produce a library in draw.io from these icons & publish online
> * refine the most important icons by adding connection points


**Quality**

Anyone can make screenshots of the extensive documentation so the purpose of this contribution is to enhance the users's speed and quality of planning their designs & documenting.  If we set up a good enough starting point, it's a no-brainer to go ahead and learn draw.io and share the results, since it's already cloud-friendly, lightweight files, and modifiable.


# Docs Resources

## Learn Documentation

The following links offer guidance on coding and development of documentation.  Originating from the software world, the term "documentation" in the open source context has its own story, best practices, and living community behind several projects that are helping engineers document their work for open collaboration.

> * [Docsify this](https://docsify-this.net/#/) - a toolkit made by educator Paul Hibbits to generate docs.
> * [Readthedocs.io](https://readthedocs.org/) - a system that integrates into git repository for documenting software automatically.  May not be the great for documenting non-software projects.
> * [Markdown Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html "Github's Style Guide")
> * [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/ "guide at markdown.org")
> * [Open source inventory management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeTejr0Am4w) - a see video for future exploration.
